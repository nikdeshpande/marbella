 Overview of SQL. 
 
1) Does ANSI recognize the data type DATE? 
Yes,date complies with the ANSI SQL standard definition for the Gregorian calendar: 
" Datetime data types will allow dates in the Gregorian format to be stored in the date range 0001-01-01 CE through 9999-12-31 CE."
The default string literal format, which is used for down-level clients, complies with the SQL standard form that is defined as YYYY-MM-DD.
This format is the same as the ISO 8601 definition for DATE.

2) Which subdivision of SQL is used to insert values in tables? 
Insert into Values(col1,col2,col3);
Data Manipulation Language(DML)
we used DML-data manupulation language.
To insert data into table you can use normal INSERT command.
Command->insert into table(column1,column2)values(value1,value2).
In that way we just insert the values in the tables.
