1) Create a union of two queries that shows the names, cities, and ratings of all customers. 
Those with rating of 200 or greater will also have the words “High Rating”, while the others 
will have the words “Low Rating”.

select cname,city,"Low Rating" rating

from customer 
where rating <200

union

select cname,city, "High Rating" rating 

from customer
where rating >=200; 
==========================================================================================

2) Write a command that produces the name and number of each salesperson and each customer 
with more than one current order. Put the results in alphabetical order.

select cname,customer.cnum,sname,salespeople.snum 
from salespeople,customer 
where salespeople.snum=customer.snum and customer.snum in

(select snum from customer group by snum having count(snum)>1);
==============================================================================================

3) Form a union of three queries. Have the first select the snums of all salespeople in San 
Jose; the second, the cnums of all customers in San Jose; and the third the onums of all 
orders on October 3. Retain duplicates between the last two queries but eliminate any 
redundancies between either of them and the first.
(Note: in the sample tables as given, there would be no such redundancy. This is besides the 
point.)

select snum from salespeople where city='san jose'

union

(select cnum from customer where city ='san jose'

union all

select onum from orders where odate='1990-10-03');
